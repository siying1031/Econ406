# Question 1
# This function takes deposited money and annual interest rate
# as input, and returns the total wealth after 10 years.

# Question 4: List
# Creates a list with the information of customer's savings.

# Question 5: Dictionary
# Creates a dictionary with the information of customer's savings.    
Accounts = {}
Accounts['Bill']= 1000
Accounts['Jack']= 5000
Accounts['Amy']= 6700
Accounts['Cindy']= 5699

# Question 6: Tuples
# Creates a list of tuples that contain all the information in the dictionary.
# k,v is abbreviation of key value pair
new_list = [(k,v) for k,v in Accounts.items()]
print(new_list)


# Question 7: Differences among, list, dictionary, and sets

# List, dictionary,and sets are all fundamental data structures.
# List is mutable and can store a sequence of objects in a certain order,
# which the objects can be indexed.

# Dictionary is mutable with a key-value pair structure.
# However, it is not ordered, elements are accessed using key or value.

# Set is mutable and is an unordered collection data type. 
# It is a method for checking whether a specific element is contained in the set.

# When we have a set of unique keys, we can map those values to a key-value 
# structure using dictionary.
# When we have an ordered collection of items, we use list.

# List keeps order, dictionary and set do not.
# Dictionary connects each key with a value, but list and set contain only values.
# Set forbids duplicates, list does not.
